# COVID-19_Detection_CNN

In this assignment you will work with a dataset, which consists of images of lung CT 
Scans available on Kaggle. You are required to develop a classifier that can take an 
image of a lung scan as input and predict whether the individual has COVID-19 or not. 
You need to train and evaluate your models using 5-fold cross validation of the data 
available at the aforementioned link (you can combine the positive and negative 
examples and use stratified cross validation).
